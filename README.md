# Quick Saipos: Client Information Deployment Tool

## Overview

This repository contains Quick Saipos, a program developed to streamline the deployment process at Saipos. It optimizes the insertion of client information into a form via Electron. The program utilizes Puppeteer to automate the insertion of client data directly into the system, enhancing efficiency and maximizing time utilization.

## Motivation

Quick Saipos was developed to improve the deployment workflow at Saipos by reducing manual data entry tasks and minimizing the potential for human error. By automating the insertion of client information into the system, it aims to optimize the deployment process and ensure accurate and consistent data entry.

## Functionality

The program leverages Electron to create a user-friendly interface for inputting client information into a form. Once the necessary data is entered, Quick Saipos utilizes Puppeteer to navigate to the system's interface and populate the required fields with the provided information. This automated process eliminates the need for manual data entry and significantly speeds up the deployment procedure.
